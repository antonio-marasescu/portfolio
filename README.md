# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website containing the code for the website, the structure for the resume and the necessary infrastructure as code for hosting.

## Bootstrap

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm start`
- Run `npm dev` to run locally

## Structure

- `/src` the frontend application code.
- `/infra` the CDK code for hosting on AWS.
- `/.github/workflows` for the project deployment pipelines.

## Acknowledgments

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
- [PrimeNg](https://primeng.org/)
