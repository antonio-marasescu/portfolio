# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website containing the code for the website, the structure for the pdf resume and the necessary infrastructure as code for hosting.

## Bootstrap

-   Clone the repository
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `npm dev` to run locally

## Structure

-   `/src` the frontend application code.
-   `/infrastructure` the CDK code for hosting on AWS.
-   `/.github/workflows` for the project deployment pipelines.
-   `antonio-resume.json` the [json resume standard](https://jsonresume.org/) for the pdf.
